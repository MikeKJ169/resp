How to get priority up / down buttons in your model
===================================================


You need this in your project-level urls.py:

    (r'^alter-priority/', include('alter_priority.urls')),

This at the top of your models.py:

    from alter_priority.views import priority_controls_func

This in the model class:

    priority_controls = priority_controls_func

and 'priority_controls' in the list_display tuple

That should be it
